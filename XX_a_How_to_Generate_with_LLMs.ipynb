As an alternative to using the output’s length as a stopping criteria, you can choose to stop generation whenever the full generation exceeds some amount of time. To learn more, check StoppingCriteria.\n",
    "- `num_beams`: by specifying a number of beams higher than 1, you are effectively switching from greedy search to beam search. This strategy evaluates several hypotheses at each time step and eventually chooses the hypothesis that has the overall highest probability for the entire sequence. This has the advantage of identifying high-probability sequences that start with a lower probability initial tokens and would’ve been ignored by the greedy search. Visualize how it works here.\n",
    "- `do_sample`: if set to True, this parameter enables decoding strategies such as multinomial sampling, beam-search multinomial sampling, Top-K sampling and Top-p sampling. All these strategies select the next token from the probability distribution over the entire vocabulary with various strategy-specific adjustments.\n",
    "- `num_return_sequences`: the number of sequence candidates to return for each input. This option is only available for the decoding strategies that support multiple sequence candidates, e.g. variations of beam search and sampling. Decoding strategies like greedy search and contrastive search return a single output sequence."

    "\n",
    "The `temperature` parameter in LLMs directly affects the variability and randomness of generated responses. A lower LLM `temperature` value (close to 0) produces more deterministic and focused outputs, ideal for tasks requiring factual accuracy, such as summarization or translation. Conversely, a higher `temperature` value (e.g., 1.0 or above) introduces more diversity and creativity, as the model samples from a broader range of possible words. This makes higher temperatures suitable for creative writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, a lower `temperature` makes the distribution $P(w|w_{1:t-1})$ sharper (increasing the likelihood of high probability words and decreasing the likelihood of low probability words) by lowering the `temperature` of the [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function#Smooth_arg_max). \n",
    "\n",
    "For applications needing highly reliable and reproducible outputs, setting a lower LLM `temperature` (e.g., 0.2-0.3) helps maintain quality and reduces unexpected responses. In contrast, interactive applications like chatbots (or any content creation task) can benefit from a mid-range `temperature` (e.g., 0.7-0.9), allowing the model to be engaging without straying too far from meaningful responses.\n",

    "Contrastive Search is a [method proposed in 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06417) that suppresses token repetition by making it more difficult to select token sequences that have been outputed previously. It suppresses repetitions more effectively than Beam Search with an equivalent amount of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the token $x_t$ at time $t$, the selection of $v$ from the token candidates $V^k$ is determined according to the following evaluation function. The terme `model confidence` is the probability value calculated by the model for the next tokens (i.e. the probability value of the token candidate $v$ given past tokens $x_{<t}$). In Greedy Search, the next token is determined only from this term.\n",

    "\n",
    "In `Contrastive Search`, a `degeneration penalty` term is added as a penalty. This penalty is calculated based on the past token sequence $x_j$ and the current candidate token $v$, and is subtracted from the probability value output by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, $s$ represents the `cosine similarity` of the token’s hidden states. For each candidate token $v$, the model’s inference is performed again to obtain its hidden state. An 'cosine similarity' with past hidden states is calculated, and if the candidate token is semantically close to previous tokens, a higher penalty is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model’s inference is performed to calculate the hidden states for all candidates, the computational load becomes significant. Therefore, the penalty is calculated only for the `top_k` candidates with the highest probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "$α$ is a parameter used to control the penalty. If it is set to 0, the process is equivalent to Greedy Search."
